# CSC-151
Data Structures and Algorithms Course. Repo contains projects and related work pertaining to course. 

# [Homework 2 - Linked Lists](https://github.com/NeilD-18/CSC-151/tree/main/Homework%202)
Implemented three methods for a LinkedList class. Methods were removeHead, insertAtTail and indexOf. Also created a JUnit testing suite to ensure proper functionality, considering numerous edge cases. 

# [Homework 3 - Generic PriorityQueue](https://github.com/NeilD-18/CSC-151/tree/main/Homework%203)
Implemented a PriorityQueue ADT using an array-based approach. It allows insertion of elements and removal of the highest priority element, leveraging the Comparable interface for comparing elements' priorities. 

# [Homework 4 - Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/NeilD-18/CSC-151/tree/main/Homework%204)
Implemented a Binary Search Tree. Homework assignment involved writing both recursive and iterative insert methods, as well as recursive methods for search, size, and toString.

# [Project 1 - We're In the Money](https://github.com/NeilD-18/CSC-151/tree/main/Project%201%20-%20We%20Are%20in%20The%20Money)
Object-Oriented Programming Project in Java. Models a Roll-A-Coin Bank from the 1980s. Project involved refactoring old code to make it more reusable, robust, and readable. Behavior remained the same while implementation drastically changed. Unit tests done using JUnit Framework

# [Project 2 - Get In Line](https://github.com/NeilD-18/CSC-151/tree/main/Project%202%20-%20Get%20in%20Line)
Implemented a Sequence ADT. Tests done using JUnit Framework. 

# [Project 3 - Get In Line (LL Based)](https://github.com/NeilD-18/CSC-151/tree/main/Project%203%20-%20Get%20in%20Line%20(LL%20Based))
Refactored the Sequence ADT to be LinkedList based. Unit testing done using JUnit Framework

# [Project 4 - The Infix to Postfix Converter](https://github.com/NeilD-18/CSC-151/tree/main/Project%204%20-%20The%20Infix%20to%20Postfix%20Converter/src)
This project implements an infix to postfix converter using an array-based stack ADT. The infix expression is parsed, and operators are reordered according to postfix rules, leveraging the stack for operator precedence and operand handling.
